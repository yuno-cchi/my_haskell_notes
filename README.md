# Me Learning Haskell, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Monad
### learning Haskell because I hate myself

My (work in progress) repositry of personal notes I make while learning Haskell, in Markdown.

I will mainly be following Philipp Hagenlocher's "Haskell for Imperative Programmers" YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV), but I will also be studying other references such as Miran Lipovaƒça's [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen's [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/).
